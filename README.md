# January Flight Delay Prediction

In this project I will work on building machine learning models able to predict the flight delay at the destination airport specifically for the month of January in upcoming years as the data is for January only. The data is collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Govt. of the USA. This dataset contains all the flights in the month January 2020. There are more than 400,000 flights in the month of January itself throughout the United States. The features were manually chosen to do a primary time series analysis.
